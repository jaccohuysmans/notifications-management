#Notifications-management

This contains the code for the web client. This client is used by administrators to look up notifications that were reported using a mobile client [like for instance](https://github.com/jaccohuysmans/notifications-android). 
This app is part of the Notifications project. Read more about that [HERE](https://github.com/jaccohuysmans/notifications--main/blob/master/README.md)


###Notes

- In order to locally run this app you need a webserver. Make sure it serves the index.html as the starting point.
- This app expects a runnning backend with an API (like this [Play/Scala based backand](https://github.com/jaccohuysmans/notifications-backend-scala) for example)
- and  make sure to change the URL to that API in nofifications.js if needed.
